# Exploring Machine Learning and Deep Learning

These projects were created with the aim of learning and exploring new areas of interest.

- ## [EUR/USD Forex Market Prediction](https://github.com/spoluan/Forex_market_prediction_EUR_USD)
  Forex is a global marketplace where currencies are bought and sold, with a daily trading volume reaching trillions of dollars, making it the largest and most liquid financial market. Forex trading involves speculating on fluctuations in exchange rates between different currency pairs, such as EUR/USD and GBP/JPY. EUR/USD is one of the most actively traded currency pairs, representing the exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar. The exchange rate between these currencies is influenced by economic indicators, political events, central bank policies, and market sentiment. Traders and investors analyze historical price data and use technical and fundamental analysis techniques to predict future movements in the EUR/USD exchange rate. In this project, a Conv1D model with a MultiHeadAttention layer is used for predicting the future price of this time series data.

- ## [IMDB Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/spoluan/IMDB_sentiment_analysis)
  For this project, I will be implementing sentiment analysis on the large movie review dataset. This dataset is specifically designed for binary sentiment classification, and consists of 50,000 movie reviews, with 25,000 reviews allocated for training and the other 25,000 for testing. The dataset provides a vast collection of data for conducting sentiment analysis.

- ## [Smart Basket](https://github.com/spoluan/rpi-smart-wastebasket)
  The Smart Basket project is a unique approach to waste management. By utilizing the distinct sound that each piece of trash creates when it falls into the basket, the project aims to classify the type of trash being discarded. To achieve this, multiple microphones are placed underneath the basket to record the sound, triggered by ultrasonic sensors at the mouth of the basket. The collected data is then processed using a combination of Conv1D and LSTM neural networks to train the trash classification model. The project was developed for a competition and has been implemented on a Raspberry Pi with an accuracy rate of over 90%. The Smart Basket project offers a promising solution for automated waste sorting, reducing the need for manual sorting and increasing recycling rates.
