# Exploring Machine Learning and Deep Learning

These projects I created with the aim of learning and exploring new areas of interest.

- ## [EUR/USD Forex Market Prediction](https://github.com/spoluan/Forex_market_prediction_EUR_USD)
  Forex is a global marketplace where currencies are bought and sold, with a daily trading volume reaching trillions of dollars, making it the largest and most liquid financial market. Forex trading involves speculating on fluctuations in exchange rates between different currency pairs, such as EUR/USD and GBP/JPY. EUR/USD is one of the most actively traded currency pairs, representing the exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar. The exchange rate between these currencies is influenced by economic indicators, political events, central bank policies, and market sentiment. Traders and investors analyze historical price data and use technical and fundamental analysis techniques to predict future movements in the EUR/USD exchange rate. In this project, a Conv1D model with a MultiHeadAttention layer is used for predicting the future price of this time series data.

- ## [IMDB Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/spoluan/IMDB_sentiment_analysis)
  For this project, I will be implementing sentiment analysis on the large movie review dataset. This dataset is specifically designed for binary sentiment classification, and consists of 50,000 movie reviews, with 25,000 reviews allocated for training and the other 25,000 for testing. The dataset provides a vast collection of data for conducting sentiment analysis.

- ## [Smart Basket](https://github.com/spoluan/rpi-smart-wastebasket)
  The Smart Basket project is a unique approach to waste management. By utilizing the distinct sound that each piece of trash creates when it falls into the basket, the project aims to classify the type of trash being discarded. To achieve this, multiple microphones are placed underneath the basket to record the sound, triggered by ultrasonic sensors at the mouth of the basket. The collected data is then processed using a combination of Conv1D and LSTM neural networks to train the trash classification model. The project was developed for a competition and has been implemented on a Raspberry Pi with an accuracy rate of over 90%. The Smart Basket project offers a promising solution for automated waste sorting, reducing the need for manual sorting and increasing recycling rates.

- ## [Medical Abstracts Classification](https://github.com/spoluan/PubMed200kRCT_medical_abstracts_classification)
  The Medical Abstracts dataset is a collection of text data consisting of medical abstracts from various research articles. The dataset is categorized into five classes, namely BACKGROUND, CONCLUSIONS, METHODS, OBJECTIVE, and RESULTS, which correspond to different sections of the research articles. This dataset provides a valuable resource for developing natural language processing (NLP) models for text classification and information extraction in the medical domain. In this project, I aim to implement a machine learning model that can accurately classify the medical abstracts into their respective classes.

- ## [US Insurance Regression](https://github.com/spoluan/USInsurance_regression)
  The aim of this project is to predict the next charge of health insurance for individuals in the United States using a dataset containing various factors, including age, BMI, smoking status, region, and number of children. The dataset provides valuable insights into the cost of health insurance and allows us to analyze the factors that influence the charges. The prediction of the next charge of health insurance can assist individuals and insurance companies in planning and budgeting for future expenses. In this project, I will use machine learning algorithms to build a model that can accurately predict the next charge of health insurance for individuals based on their demographic and health-related information.

- ## [TMDB Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/spoluan/TMDB_5000_Movie_recommendation_system)
  This project focuses on developing a movie recommendation system using a hybrid approach that combines both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. The dataset used for this project will include movie titles, genres, and other related features. Content-based filtering will be utilized to analyze the user's movie preferences and recommend similar movies based on their genre, keywords, and taglines. Collaborative filtering will consider the user's movie ratings and suggest highly-rated movies by users with similar preferences. To enhance the accuracy of the system, I will also incorporate a weighted average method. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide an efficient and personalized movie recommendation system that enhances the overall movie watching experience of the user.

- ## [Cats and Dogs Classification](https://github.com/spoluan/Cat_dogs_classification)
  In this project, I will be implementing a binary image classification system to differentiate between cats and dogs. The dataset used for this project will consist of a large number of images of cats and dogs, which will be used to train and validate the deep learning model. The goal of this project is to develop an accurate classification system that can effectively distinguish between cats and dogs in real-world images. This project can have many potential applications, such as automatic pet monitoring systems, animal behavior studies, and more. By accurately classifying images of cats and dogs, this project can contribute to advancements in computer vision technology and improve the accuracy and efficiency of various related applications.


- ## [Flower Classification](https://github.com/spoluan/FlowerClassification)
  In this project, I will be implementing a flower classification system. The system will use deep learning techniques to identify different species of flowers based on their images. The dataset used for this project will consist of images of various flowers, including daisies, roses, sunflowers, and tulips. The goal of this project is to build a model that accurately classifies images of flowers, which can be useful in fields such as agriculture, botany, and horticulture.  
 
- ## [Fashion MNIST classification](https://github.com/spoluan/Fashion_mnist_classification)
  Fashion MNIST classification is a project that involves the classification of different types of clothing items using machine learning algorithms. The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items that are 28x28 pixels in size. The dataset is divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with each image belonging to one of 10 different categories such as T-shirt/top, trouser, pullover, dress, coat, sandal, shirt, sneaker, bag, and ankle boot. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify the different clothing items based on the provided images. This project is suitable for beginners in machine learning and provides a great opportunity to apply different classification algorithms and evaluate their performance.
